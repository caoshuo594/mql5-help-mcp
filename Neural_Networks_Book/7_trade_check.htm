<p class="p_H1"><span class="f_H1">7. Testing trading capabilities of the model</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">We have done quite a bit of work studying various architectural solutions for organizing neural networks. We have created a library for building various neural layers, and now with its help, we can create different neural network models to find the best solution for our tasks. This is all very good and useful, of course. However, we are doing this not just for the sake of science or self-enlightenment, although that is certainly not a bad reason to study something. In this case, we embarked on the study of the organization of neural networks and their architectural solutions with a practical purpose to find a solution for use in the financial markets. There are two visions for such a solution:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Creating an indicator based on a neural network model.</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Creating an Expert Advisor capable of executing trading operations based on the signals of the neural network model.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">We will not discuss which of the above options is preferable. In fact, this is a rhetorical question because it depends on the user's personal preferences. In any case, we need to organize the correct operation of the model and the interpretation of its signals.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">At the same time, we would like to assess the expected profitability of our model. To conduct such work, the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">MetaTrader 5</span><span class="f_Text"> terminal offers the use of the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">Strategy Tester</span><span class="f_Text">.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">In this chapter, we move from the theoretical study and creation of neural networks to the practical application of the developed models in the financial sector. Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of neural networks for creating indicators and Expert Advisors capable of performing trading operations in financial markets. We'll start by examining the <a href="7_1_strategy_tester.htm" class="topiclink">functionality of the MetaTrader 5 Strategy Tester</a>, which is a key tool for evaluating the performance of our models.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Next, we will move on to creating an <a href="7_2_expert_template.htm" class="topiclink">Expert Advisor template</a> using the MQL5 programming language. This will allow us to apply our models in real trading conditions. Then we will focus on <a href="7_3_tester_model.htm" class="topiclink">creating a model for testing</a>. In this part, we will see how to properly prepare and configure the model to produce the most accurate and useful results.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">After that, we will discuss the <a href="7_4_set_ea_settiongs.htm" class="topiclink">definition of Expert Advisor parameters</a>, which includes setting various parameters and options that optimize the Expert Advisor operation in accordance with the user's trading strategies and goals. Finally, we will <a href="7_5_forward_testing.htm" class="topiclink">test the model</a> using new data, which is a critical step in assessing the model's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and predict future trading signals.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">This chapter focuses on the practical application of the developed neural networks in real-world trading strategies, covering model testing and optimization stages.</span></p>
