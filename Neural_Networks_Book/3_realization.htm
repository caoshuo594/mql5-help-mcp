<p class="p_H1"><span class="f_H1">3. Building the first neural network model using MQL5</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">This book should not be regarded as a textbook for studying artificial intelligence and neural networks. Its purpose is not to serve as a comprehensive work that encompasses all aspects of this field. On the contrary, the book provides only the basic concepts without delving into the mathematical explanations of specific points.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">It aims to be a practical work. We invite you to explore possible solutions to a practical case and compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in solving a particular problem. We believe this book will be useful in studying the practical implementation of various neural network algorithms, their training, and practical use.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">And, of course, our case study will be directly related to financial markets. Artificial intelligence technologies have long been used in the financial sector, but this topic has not yet received wide coverage. This is largely due to the commercial use of such products.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">This chapter delves into the topic of algorithmic trading, with an emphasis on demonstrating various methodologies for addressing tasks related to algorithmic trading, as well as analyzing and comparing the performance of different algorithmic approaches. The discussion is based on a clear <a href="3_1_task.htm" class="topiclink">statement of the problem</a>, which includes defining key objectives and constraints specific to the financial markets context.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">A separate section covers the <a href="3_3_initial_data.htm" class="topiclink">selection and analysis of raw data</a>, including the choice of suitable financial metrics and the analysis of their correlations. It also explains the features of time series, which are critically important for successfully forecasting market movements. Also, the chapter shows how to create the <a href="3_4_basic.htm" class="topiclink">framework of the future program</a> in MQL5 and how to declare constants to ensure code robustness and portability. You will learn how to describe the structure of the created neural network and how to effectively organize work with complex network architectures.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">In the section on <a href="3_4_3_neuron_base.htm" class="topiclink">creating the base neural network class</a>, you will be introduced to the concepts of feed-forward and backpropagation runs in the context of neural network programming. Special attention is given to dynamic arrays for storing neural layers, greatly simplifying the management of complex data structures during the development process.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The description of methods for integrating a neural network into a Python program provides an understanding of how various components of a neural network can be combined into a single system using the capabilities of this popular programming language. The section on the <a href="3_6_perceptron.htm" class="topiclink">fully connected neural layer</a> provides details about its architecture and creation principles, explaining the general structure and operation of such layers in neural networks. In addition, it covers the process of creating an activation function class and selecting appropriate activation functions.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The section on <a href="3_7_pr_opencl.htm" class="topiclink">parallel computing using OpenCL</a> demonstrates how this technology can be used to speed up computational processes in neural networks. This solution can significantly increase the efficiency of data processing by distributing tasks among several computing devices.</span></p>
