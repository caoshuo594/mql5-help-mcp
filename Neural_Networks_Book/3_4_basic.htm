<p class="p_H2"><span class="f_H2">3.4 Creating the framework for the future MQL5 program</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">In the previous section, we talked about preparatory work and methods for selecting indicators for analysis by a neural network. After conducting the analysis, we have determined a set of indicators to train the neural network and the depth of historical data to be loaded.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Now let's move on to the practical part of our book. We will look at various neural network algorithms and architectures. You will learn the specifics of constructing and implementing a fully connected perceptron, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. After that, we will discuss the features and advantages of attention mechanisms. Finally, we will look at the GPT architecture, which, at the time of writing the book, demonstrates the best results in natural language processing problems.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">As we explore the algorithms, step by step, we will create a tool for designing and organizing neural networks using MQL5. Each algorithm under consideration will be implemented in three versions: </span><span class="f_li">MQL5, OpenCL, and Python.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">We will build and train neural networks using all the learned algorithms. Then, we will practically assess the strengths and weaknesses of their use for time series forecasting. We will train and test the built models on real data. And, of course, during the training process, we will discuss the nuances of this process.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The book will showcase the practical results of using neural networks to solve the problem defined in the previous sections, using real-world data. During testing, we will conduct a comparative analysis of various implementations and evaluate the practical effectiveness of each implementation in solving the given problem.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Let's begin working on refining the architecture of our future tool. It's quite logical to consolidate our entire development into a single entity (class) that can be easily integrated into any program. This way, we'll be able to configure the entire operation of our model within this class.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">At the same time, we need to ensure the ability to create models of various architectures within our main model. The architecture of the model itself will be defined in the main program and passed to the class through created interfaces. To make this process convenient and easy to use, it is necessary to standardize it. To address standardization matters, we will use constants and named enumerations.</span></p>
