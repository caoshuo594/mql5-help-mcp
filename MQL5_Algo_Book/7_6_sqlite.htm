<p class="p_H2"><span class="f_H2">7.6 SQLite database</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">MetaTrader 5 provides native support for the SQLite database. It is a light yet fully functional database management system (DBMS). Traditionally, such systems are focused on processing data tables, where records of the same type are stored with a common set of attributes, and different correspondences (links or relations) can be established between records of different types (i.e. tables), and therefore such databases are also called relational. We have already considered examples of such connections between structures of the <a href="7_3_1_calendar_overview.htm" class="topiclink">economic calendar</a>, but the calendar database is stored inside the terminal, and the functions of this section will allow you to create arbitrary databases from MQL programs.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The specialization of the DBMS on these data structures allows you to optimize – speed up and simplify – many popular operations such as sorting, searching, filtering, summing up, or calculating other aggregate functions for large amounts of data.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">However, there is another side to this: DBMS programming requires its own SQL (Structured Query Language), and knowledge of pure MQL5 will not be enough. Unlike MQL5, which refers to </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">imperative</span><span class="f_Text"> languages (those using operators indicating what, how, in what sequence to do), SQL is </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">declarative</span><span class="f_Text">, that is, it describes the initial data and the desired result, without specifying how and in what sequence to perform calculations. The meaning of the algorithm in SQL is described in the form of SQL queries. A query is an analog of a separate MQL5 operator, formed as a string using a special syntax.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Instead of programming complex loops and comparisons, we can simply call SQLite functions (for example, </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;"><a href="7_6_5_sqlite_simple_queries.htm" class="topiclink">DatabaseExecute</a></span><span class="f_Text"> or </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;"><a href="7_6_7_sqlite_prepare.htm" class="topiclink">Database Prepare</a></span><span class="f_Text">) by passing SQL queries to them. To get query results into a ready-made MQL5 structure, you can use the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;"><a href="7_6_10_sqlite_read.htm" class="topiclink">DatabaseReadBind</a></span><span class="f_Text"> function. This will allow you to read all the fields of the record (structure) at once in one call.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">With the help of database functions, it is easy to create tables, add records to them, make modifications, and make selections according to complex conditions, for example, for tasks such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Obtaining trading history and quotes</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Saving optimization and testing results</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Preparing and exchanging data with other analysis packages</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Analyzing economic calendar data</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li">Storing settings and states of MQL5 programs</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">In addition, a wide range of common, statistical, and mathematical functions can be used in SQL queries. Moreover, expressions with their participation can be calculated even without creating a table.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SQLite does not require a separate application, configuration, and administration, is not resource-demanding, and supports most commands of the popular SQL92 standard. An added convenience is that the entire database resides in a single file on the hard drive on the user's computer and can be easily transferred or backed up. However, to speed up read, write, and modification operations, the database can also be opened/created in RAM with the flag <a href="7_6_4_sqlite_db_create_open_close.htm" class="topiclink">DATABASE_OPEN_MEMORY</a>, however, in this case, such a database will be available only to this particular program and cannot be used for joint work of several programs.</span></p>
<p class="p_Quote"><span class="f_Quote">It is important to note that the relative simplicity of SQLite, compared to full-featured DBMSs, comes with some limitations. In particular, SQLite does not have a dedicated process (system service or application) that would provide centralized access to the database and table management API, which is why parallel, shared access to the same database (file) from different processes is not guaranteed. So, if you need to simultaneously read and write to the database from optimization agents that execute instances of the same Expert Advisor, you will need to write code in it to synchronize access (otherwise, the data being written and read will be in an inconsistent state: after all, the order of writing, modifying, deleting, and reading from concurrent unsynchronized processes are random). Moreover, attempts to change the database at the same time may result in the MQL program receiving &quot;database busy&quot; errors (and the requested operation is not performed). The only scenario that does not require synchronization of parallel operations with SQLite is when only read operations are involved.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">We will present only the basics of SQL to the extent necessary to start applying it. A complete description of the syntax and how SQL works is beyond the scope of this book. Check out the documentation on the SQLite site. However, please note that MQL5 and MetaEditor support a limited subset of commands and <a href="7_6_1_sqlite_overview.htm" class="topiclink">SQL syntax constructions</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">MQL Wizard</span><span class="f_Text"> in MetaEditor has an embedded option to create a database, which immediately offers to create the first table by defining a list of its fields. Also, the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">Navigator</span><span class="f_Text"> provides a separate tab for working with databases.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Using the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">Wizard</span><span class="f_Text"> or the context menu of the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">Navigator</span><span class="f_Text">, you can create an empty database (a file on disk, placed by default, in the directory </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">MQL5/Files</span><span class="f_Text">) of supported formats (*.db, *.sql, *.sqlite and others). In addition, in the context menu, you can import the entire database from an sql file or individual tables from csv files.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">An existing or created database can be easily opened through the same menu. After that, its tables will appear in the </span><span class="f_Text" style="font-style: italic;">Navigator</span><span class="f_Text">, and the right, main area of the window will display a panel with tools for debugging SQL queries and a table with the results. For example, double-clicking on a table name performs a quick query of all record fields, which corresponds to the &quot;SELECT * FROM 'table'&quot; statement that appears in the input field at the top.</span></p>
