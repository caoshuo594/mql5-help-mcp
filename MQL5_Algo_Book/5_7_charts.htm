<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Most MQL programs, such as scripts, indicators, and Expert Advisors, are executed on charts. Only services run in the background, without being tied to a schedule. A rich set of functions is provided for obtaining and changing the properties of graphs, analyzing their list, and searching for other running programs.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Since charts are the natural environment for indicators, we have already had a chance to get acquainted with some of these features in the previous indicator chapters. In this chapter, we will study all these functions in a targeted manner.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">When working with charts, we will use the concept of a window. A window is a dedicated area that displays price charts and/or indicator charts. The top and, as a rule, the largest window contains price charts, has the number 0, and always exists. All additional windows added to the lower part when placing indicators are numbered from 1 and higher (numbering from top to bottom). Each subwindow exists only as long as it has at least one indicator.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Since the user can delete all indicators in an arbitrary subwindow, including the one that is not the last (the lowest), the indexes of the remaining subwindows can decrease.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The event model of charts related to receiving and processing notifications about events on charts and generating custom events will be discussed in a <a href="5_9_events.htm" class="topiclink">separate chapter</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">In addition to the &quot;charts in windows&quot; discussed here, MetaTrader 5 also allows you to create &quot;charts in objects&quot;. We will deal with <a href="5_8_objects.htm" class="topiclink">graphical objects</a> in the next chapter.</span></p>
