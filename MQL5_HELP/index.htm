<p class="p_H1"><span class="f_H1">MQL5 Reference</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">MetaQuotes Language 5 (MQL5) is a high-level language designed for developing technical indicators, trading robots and utility applications, which automate financial trading. MQL5 has been developed by <a href="https://www.metaquotes.net" target="_blank" class="weblink">MetaQuotes</a> for their trading platform. The language syntax is very close to C++ enabling programmers to develop applications in the object-oriented programming (OOP) style.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">In addition to the MQL5 language, the trading platform package also includes the <a href="https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help" target="_blank" class="weblink">MetaEditor IDE</a> with highly advanced code writing tools, such as templates, snippets, debugging, profiling and auto completion tools, as well as built-in <a href="https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5storage" target="_blank" class="weblink">MQL5 Storage</a> enabling file versioning.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The language support is available on the MQL5 Algotrading community website, which contains a huge <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/code" target="_blank" class="weblink">free CodeBase</a> and a plethora of <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/articles" target="_blank" class="weblink">articles</a>.

<p class="p_H2"><span class="f_H2">Types of MQL5 Applications</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">MQL5 programs are divided into five specialized types based on the trading automation tasks that they implement:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li class="p_li"><a name="expert" class="hmanchor"></a><span class="f_li" style="font-weight: bold;">Expert Advisor</span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span class="f_li">is an automated trading system linked to a chart. An Expert Advisor contains <a href="events.htm" class="topiclink">event</a> handlers to manage predefined events which activate execution of appropriate trading strategy elements. For example, an event of program initialization and deinitializtion, new ticks, timer events, changes in the Depth of Market, chart and custom events.</span><br>
<span class="f_li">In addition to calculating trading signals based on the implemented rules, Expert Advisors can also automatically execute trades and send them directly to a trading server. Expert Advisors are stored in </span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;Terminal_Directory&gt;\MQL5\Experts</span><span class="f_li">.</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><a name="indicator" class="hmanchor"></a><span class="f_li" style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Indicator</span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">s</span><span class="f_li"> is a technical indicator developed by a user in addition to standard indicators integrated into the trading platform. Custom indicators, as well as standard ones, cannot trade automatically, but only implement analytical functions. Custom indicators can utilize values of other indicators for calculations, and can be called from Expert Advisors.</span><br>
<span class="f_li">Custom indicators are stored in </span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;Terminal_Directory&gt;\MQL5\Indicators</span><span class="f_li">.</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><a name="script" class="hmanchor"></a><span class="f_li" style="font-weight: bold;">Script</span><span class="f_li"> is a program for a single execution of an action. Unlike Expert Advisors, scripts do not handle any event except for trigger. A script code must contain the OnStart handler function.</span><br>
<span class="f_li">Scripts are stored in </span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;Terminal_DIrectory&gt;\MQL5\Scripts</span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li class="p_li"><a name="service" class="hmanchor"></a><span class="f_li" style="font-weight: bold;">Service</span><span class="f_li"> is a program that, unlike indicators, Expert Advisors and scripts, does not require to be bound to a chart to work. Like scripts, services do not handle any event except for trigger. To launch a service, its code should contain the OnStart handler function. Services do not accept any other events except Start, but they are able to send custom events to charts using <a href="eventchartcustom.htm" class="topiclink">EventChartCustom</a>. Services are stored in &lt;terminal_directory&gt;\MQL5\Services.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li class="p_li"><a name="library" class="hmanchor"></a><span class="f_li" style="font-weight: bold;">Library </span><span class="f_li">is a set of custom functions. Libraries are intended to store and distribute commonly used algorithms of custom programs.</span><br>
<span class="f_li">Libraries are stored in </span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;Terminal_Directory&gt;\MQL5\Libraries</span><span class="f_li">.</span></li>
<li class="p_li"><span class="f_li" style="font-weight: bold;">Include File</span><span class="f_li"> is a source text of the most frequently used blocks of custom programs. Such files can be included into the source texts of Expert Advisors, scripts, custom indicators, and libraries at the compiling stage. The use of included files is more preferable than the use of libraries because of additional burden occurring at calling library functions. </span><br>
<span class="f_li">Include files can be stored in the same directory where the original file is located. In this case the <a href="include.htm" class="topiclink">#include</a> directive with double quotes is used. Another option is to store include files in </span><span class="f_li" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;Terminal_Directory&gt;\MQL5\Include</span><span class="f_li">. In this case #include with angle brackets should be used.</span></li>
